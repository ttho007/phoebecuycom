- Works well for daybed covers

### Queen Size
- Most popular size for couples
- Fits standard queen beds
- Provides good coverage without excess bulk

### King Size
- Generous size for king beds
- Extra width for couples
- Allows for ample drape on sides

### Super King Size

## Tips for Selecting Quilt Size

1. **Measure Your Bed**: Always measure your mattress before selecting a quilt size
2. **Consider Drop**: Add extra inches for desired drop length on sides
3. **Account for Shrinkage**: Some fabrics may shrink after washing
4. **Check Mattress Depth**: Deeper mattresses may require larger quilts

## Care Instructions Based on Size

Different sizes may require different care approaches:
- Throw quilts can typically be machine washed
- Larger sizes might need professional cleaning
- Consider storage space requirements for each size
