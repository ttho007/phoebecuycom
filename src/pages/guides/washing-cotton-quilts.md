# How to Wash and Dry Cotton Quilts

Cotton quilts are beloved for their comfort and durability, but proper care is essential to maintain their quality. This guide will walk you through the best practices for washing and drying your cotton quilts.

## Washing Your Cotton Quilt

1. **Check the Label**: Always follow any specific care instructions provided by the manufacturer.

2. **Pre-treat Stains**: Gently spot-clean any visible stains before washing.

3. **Machine Washing**:
   - Use a gentle or delicate cycle
   - Cold or lukewarm water (never hot)
   - Mild, liquid detergent (avoid powders)
   - Do not overload the machine

4. **Hand Washing** (for delicate or heavily embellished quilts):
   - Fill a bathtub with cool water and mild detergent
   - Gently submerge and swish the quilt
   - Avoid wringing or twisting

## Drying Your Cotton Quilt

1. **Air Drying** (Preferred Method):
   - Lay the quilt flat on a clean surface
   - Reshape while damp
   - Flip occasionally for even drying

2. **Machine Drying** (if necessary):
   - Use low heat setting
   - Remove while slightly damp to prevent over-drying
   - Add clean tennis balls to maintain fluffiness

## Additional Tips

- Wash your quilt every 3-6 months, or more often if used daily
- Always wash before storing for long periods
- Avoid direct sunlight when drying to prevent fading

By following these guidelines, you'll keep your cotton quilts clean, fresh, and beautiful for years to come.
