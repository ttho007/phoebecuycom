# Storing Quilts Properly

Proper storage is crucial for maintaining the quality and longevity of your quilts. Whether you're storing quilts for a season or long-term, these guidelines will help preserve your beautiful creations.

## Preparing Quilts for Storage

1. **Clean First**: Always store clean quilts to prevent stains and odors
2. **Ensure Completely Dry**: Moisture can lead to mold and mildew
3. **Remove Any Pins or Metal Objects**: These can rust and damage the fabric

## Choosing a Storage Location

1. **Cool, Dry Place**: Avoid attics, basements, and garages
2. **Away from Direct Sunlight**: Prevents fading and fabric degradation
3. **Good Air Circulation**: Helps prevent mustiness

## Storage Methods

1. **Flat Storage** (Ideal):
   - Use a flat surface like a spare bed or padded table
   - Place acid-free tissue paper between layers

2. **Rolling** (For Large Quilts):
   - Roll around an acid-free tube
   - Cover with unbleached muslin

3. **Folding** (If Necessary):
   - Use acid-free tissue in the folds
   - Refold periodically to prevent permanent creases

## Storage Materials

1. **Use Breathable Fabrics**: Cotton sheets or muslin covers
2. **Avoid Plastic**: Can trap moisture and cause yellowing
3. **Acid-Free Boxes**: For long-term storage

## Additional Tips

- Label storage containers for easy identification
- Inspect stored quilts periodically for any issues
- Consider using cedar blocks or lavender sachets as natural pest deterrents

By following these storage guidelines, you can ensure that your quilts remain in excellent condition, ready to be enjoyed for years to come.
