# Caring for Wool Quilts

Wool quilts are prized for their warmth, durability, and natural properties. However, they require special care to maintain their quality. This guide will help you properly care for your wool quilts.

## General Care Tips

1. **Air Regularly**: Hang your wool quilt outside on a dry, breezy day to freshen it
2. **Brush Gently**: Use a soft-bristled brush to remove dust and restore the nap
3. **Spot Clean**: Address spills immediately with a damp cloth and mild soap

## Washing Wool Quilts

1. **Frequency**: Wash only when necessary, typically once a year
2. **Method**:
   - Hand wash in cool water with wool-specific detergent
   - Do not wring or twist
   - Gently squeeze out excess water

3. **Machine Washing** (if the label allows):
   - Use wool cycle or gentle cycle
   - Cold water only
   - Wool-specific detergent
   - Place in a mesh laundry bag for extra protection

## Drying Wool Quilts

1. **Air Drying** (Preferred Method):
   - Lay flat on a clean towel
   - Reshape while damp
   - Keep away from direct heat or sunlight

2. **Machine Drying** (if absolutely necessary):
   - Use lowest heat setting
   - Remove while still slightly damp

## Storage

1. Store in a cool, dry place
2. Use cedar blocks or lavender sachets to deter moths
3. Avoid plastic bags; use breathable cotton or muslin covers

## Dealing with Moth Damage

1. Freeze the quilt for 24 hours to kill moths and eggs
2. Clean thoroughly before storing again

By following these care instructions, you can ensure that your wool quilts remain warm, beautiful, and long-lasting. Remember, the natural properties of wool make these quilts relatively low-maintenance, but proper care is key to preserving their quality.
