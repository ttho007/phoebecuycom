# Bamboo Batting for Quilts

Bamboo batting is gaining popularity among quilters for its eco-friendly properties and unique characteristics. This guide will help you understand the benefits of bamboo batting and how to incorporate it into your quilting projects.

## Benefits of Bamboo Batting

1. **Eco-Friendly**: Sustainable and biodegradable
2. **Naturally Antimicrobial**: Resistant to bacteria and odors
3. **Temperature Regulating**: Keeps you cool in summer and warm in winter
4. **Soft and Silky**: Provides a luxurious feel
5. **Hypoallergenic**: Great for those with sensitivities

## Characteristics of Bamboo Batting

- Lightweight and drapes well
- Absorbs and releases moisture efficiently
- Minimal shrinkage
- Blends well with other fibers (often mixed with cotton or silk)

## Working with Bamboo Batting

1. **Quilting Density**: Can be quilted up to 4-6 inches apart
2. **Needles**: Use a universal or quilting needle (size 80/12 or 90/14)
3. **Basting**: Works well with all basting methods

## Care for Quilts with Bamboo Batting

- Machine washable on gentle cycle
- Tumble dry on low heat or air dry
- Gets softer with each wash

## Considerations

- May be more expensive than traditional cotton batting
- Can be thinner than some other battings

Bamboo batting offers a sustainable and comfortable option for modern quilters. Its unique properties make it an excellent choice for those seeking an eco-friendly alternative that doesn't compromise on quality or comfort.
