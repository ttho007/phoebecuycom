# Quilt Color Theory

Understanding color theory is crucial for creating visually appealing quilts. This guide explores color principles and how to apply them in your quilting projects.

## Color Wheel Basics

1. **Primary Colors**: Red, Blue, Yellow
2. **Secondary Colors**: Green, Orange, Purple
3. **Tertiary Colors**: Combinations of primary and secondary

## Color Schemes

1. **Complementary**: Colors opposite on the wheel
2. **Analogous**: Colors next to each other
3. **Triadic**: Three colors equally spaced on the wheel

## Value and Contrast

- **Value**: Lightness or darkness of a color
- **Contrast**: Difference between light and dark elements

For practical application of these principles, check our [Quilt Design Principles](/pillars/quilt-design-principles) guide.

Remember, while color theory provides guidelines, trust your instincts and personal preferences when designing your quilt.
