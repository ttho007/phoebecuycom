# Quilt Design Principles

Understanding the principles of design is crucial for creating visually appealing and balanced quilts. This guide explores the fundamental design principles as they apply to quilting.

## Color Theory

### Color Wheel
- Understanding primary, secondary, and tertiary colors
- Using complementary, analogous, and triadic color schemes

### Value and Contrast

## Balance and Proportion

- Achieving visual equilibrium in your quilt design
- Using symmetrical or asymmetrical balance
- Considering the scale of different elements in your quilt

## Rhythm and Movement

- Creating a sense of motion or flow in your quilt design
- Using repetition and variation to guide the eye

## Unity and Harmony

- Creating a sense of completeness in your design

## Focal Point

- Establishing a main point of interest in your quilt
- Using size, color, or unique elements to create emphasis

## Negative Space

- Creating modern, minimalist designs with strategic use of negative space

## Applying Design Principles

1. Sketch your ideas before cutting fabric
2. Use design software or apps to experiment with layouts
